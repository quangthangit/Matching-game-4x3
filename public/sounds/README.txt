Place your sound files here:
- select.mp3 (short, light click or blip)
- correct.mp3 (pleasant chime)
- wrong.mp3 (soft error beep)
- win.mp3 (short celebratory jingle)

File-based audio will be used automatically if present. If any file is missing or blocked by the browser, the game falls back to a gentle WebAudio beep.
